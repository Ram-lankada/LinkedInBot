LinkedInBot enables you to automatically connect to people being employed at multiple MNCs based on topic search, and accepts all the Connection invitations you've received. 
Written both in JavaScript & Python

## Disclaimer 
As per my findings a user can have at max of 100 connections and 250 actions per week on LinkedIn. 
And you may get banned if you've exceeded them. 

And i've programmed explicit time waits to let the page completely before any performing any action. 
You can change those time waits in the code, if you want the process to be faster.
